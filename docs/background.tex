\section{Background and Context}

The Christ Embassy Ireland Zone operates a large network of churches, groups,
and cells spread across multiple counties. Administrative record-keeping and
reporting have historically relied on manual spreadsheets, making it difficult
to consolidate accurate data on membership, attendance, and financial
partnerships.

To improve data integrity, visibility, and coordination across the zone, a
unified digital platform is required. The Christ Embassy Ireland Zone Church
Reporting Platform provides a centralised system for recording, verifying, and
reporting key operational metrics while preserving the church’s hierarchical
structure.

The platform streamlines four existing workflows—membership management, finance
reporting, cell ministry coordination, and leadership dashboards—into a single
integrated solution optimised for accuracy, accountability, and ease of use.
